            "I am a new media artist, animator and programmer based in Helsinki, Finland. I directed *Aurinko and Selene*, *Dysmorphia* and *Takeoff* animations, displayed in multiple film festivals, worked as a video designer for stage projections in *Rottien Pyhimys* musical and *Ihmisen jälkeen* chamber opera, and was a *creative coder*, programming tutor, and a *graphic designer and exhibition curator* in Aalto University.",
            "I graduated with a Master of Arts degree in New Media from Aalto with a *thesis highlighting the pervasiveness of computation metaphor in science and culture*. My current artistic and research interests build on this exploration, which I want to deepen by investigating the aesthetic properties of the computation metaphor and their impact on the collective imaginary of algorithms and artificial intelligence.",
            "By intersecting of computer science, data visualization and new media art, I aim to weave visual counter narratives by devising feminist visual language for algorithmic representation that would deconstruct the totalistic discourses of computation both in science and culture, and foster a more critical and contextual understanding of computer logic.",

            "The animation tells a story of two children, Sun (fi. Aurinko) and Moon (gr. Selene), whose sibling bond is fractured by a genetic difference—lactose tolerance. Sun carries the gene that allows her to digest milk, while Moon does not. Their shared experience of drinking milk turns into a vivid exploration of their bodies' reactions. As colourful visuals depict their physical sensations, monochrome text frames their evolving effort to understand this difference.",

The revelation of their genetic differences becomes a metaphor for the complexity, embodiment and beauty of variation.",

In this work I morph the deformed perception of the body into a deformed perception of the mind, a mental dysmorphia. An expression of one’s self warping and deforming in the presence of others.",
            "As one goes about their day, interacts with other people, the need for an ‘I’ arises. A symbol of one's image, summary of one's existence, place in the social dynamics, a colour to the contents of one's mind.",
            "This phenomenon generates worry and stress, it feels like a contraction of consciousness, attention feedback loop like that of a painful organ (one does not acknowledge the existence of one's pancreas until it starts hurting). Self-conscious thinking patterns start poisoning every interaction one has, and the grasp on reality gets weaker and weaker. ",
            "Then, the ‘I’ starts being observed. ‘I’ starts being examined. ‘I’ starts internalising the outside observer, in the need of control. What do you think of me? How do you see me? Can I predict what image of me you have? Simone de Beauvoir said: “when a girl becomes a woman she is doubled; instead of coinciding exactly with herself she also exists outside”. Watching herself being watched.",
            "The feeling of the ‘I’ and being in control of its image - all of it is an illusion. A painful one, since the need of being in control can never be satisfied. The tendency to assume the worst leads to self-detrimental thoughts. Confrontation with the distorted image one has, leads into a squishing awkwardness, painful assignment of flaws, division of the self, indecisiveness. ",
            "Sometimes, one is able to cool down the disrupting thoughts and sensations, recover from the overwhelming realisations. Sometimes, the interaction generates reactions which one only exaggerates, spiralling into the egocentric doom. ",
            "One always hopes that it will all change. Once the ‘I’ starts fresh and wakes up to a new day, everything will be alright. Then the ‘I’ can finally become a loving partner, kind friend, engaged citizen. But with time one gets tired and learns that there is no escape to the illusion and the torment it generates. That one needs to reject the notion of the ‘I’ but at the same time reject the need to do it. One goes in a circle, being tossed by the projections of ego, external and internal. Understandably, loosing hope and giving into dysmorphia. The only solution is to coincide with the contents of the consciousness, flow without creating a narrative of it.",

The search for this mythical place is an ongoing venture for many, but I will argue that, if it ever existed, it may never be found again, not anymore. The paradise has been destroyed - by exterminating thousands of plant and animal species, destroying their habitats, and introducing drastic climate changes. Humanity carries the burden of vanity and does not cease to judge what is right, or, for that matter, which species deserve to live and which do not. By employing the role of gods on this planet, we did not leave Eden - we destroyed it and abandoned it.",

Elizabeth Kolbert in her book “The Sixth Extinction” calls the Anthropocene the next wave of mass annihilation of life on Earth and is not alone in her conclusions. With this work, I would like to visualize where we came from and where we are heading, given the current trends and socio-economical systems.",

Upon opening the eyes again, one finds him/herself in the uneasy, terrifying environment, dry and overflowing with livestock. This transition represents several dimensions of the issue of diminishing biodiversity. Approximately 96% of the mammals’ biomass on Earth comprises humanity and its livestock and in the last 50 years, the number of populations of wild animals dwindled by 60% - continuing this trend drives the wildlife extinct and fosters the absurd level of meat and dairy consumption, impossible to sustain the future tens of billions of people. This is Adam and Eve choosing who deserves to live - the species which cannot be eaten or tanned do not have a place in the world we create. Climate change and oceans acidification are other factors that diminish the natural habitats of fauna and flora, with the coral reefs being one of the first environments to become extinct in a couple of decades, represented in the second landscape as the “burning” backdrop of the whole scene. Immersed in the intense sounds of the jungle, in the beginning, one can hear the signing of many kinds of birds and insects. These animals are facing annihilation, with e.g. 75% decrease in the number of insects in the protected areas in Germany in the course of the last 30 years.",

        text: [
            "​​The paradigmatic role of computational technologies in culture and science oftentimes renders natural phenomena as well as human action, interaction and introspection as forms of computation. The inaccurate yet foundational character of those interpretations has been the motivation for my Master’s thesis. ",
            "In my research, I aimed to identify what is overstated, forgotten or taken for granted in science and culture shaped by computation, and rediscover the meaning of carbon-based bodily experience in the light of anxiety caused by the imposition of silicon-based technological advances. I used McLuhan's framework of a tetrad of human artifact influences (enhance-obscolesce-retrieve-reverse) to analyze the pervasiveness of language and concepts derived from and applied to computational technologies. Finally, I tried to convey and develop conceptual alternatives by creating the short animation “Aurinko and Selene”.",
            "The thesis is an embrace of the immediate, embodied experience of being alive. The embrace and its contraposition with the textual, conventional thought tries to reposition these impressions and codes in their own terms – one is not confused with the other. The work is a dream of reconnection with oneself and others instead of doubling into minds and bodies and isolating into the abstract, cranial chambers of rational thought.",
