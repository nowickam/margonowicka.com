            "Dysmorphia is a term related to a body-image disorder, where one believes a part of their appearance is severely distorted or flawed, in contrary to reality. In this work I morph the deformed perception of the body into a deformed perception of the mind, a mental dysmorphia. An expression of one’s self warping and deforming in the presence of others.",

            "As one goes about their day, interacts with other people, the need for an ‘I’ arises. A symbol of one's image, summary of one's existence, place in the social dynamics, a colour to the contents of one's mind.",

            "This phenomenon generates worry and stress, it feels like a contraction of consciousness, attention feedback loop like that of a painful organ (one does not acknowledge the existence of one's pancreas until it starts hurting). Self-conscious thinking patterns start poisoning every interaction one has, and the grasp on reality gets weaker and weaker. ",

            "Then, the ‘I’ starts being observed. ‘I’ starts being examined. ‘I’ starts internalising the outside observer, in the need of control. What do you think of me? How do you see me? Can I predict what image of me you have? Simone de Beauvoir said: “when a girl becomes a woman she is doubled; instead of coinciding exactly with herself she also exists outside”. Watching herself being watched.",

            "The feeling of the ‘I’ and being in control of its image - all of it is an illusion. A painful one, since the need of being in control can never be satisfied. The tendency to assume the worst leads to self-detrimental thoughts. Confrontation with the distorted image one has, leads into a squishing awkwardness, painful assignment of flaws, division of the self, indecisiveness. ",

            "Sometimes, one is able to cool down the disrupting thoughts and sensations, recover from the overwhelming realisations. Sometimes, the interaction generates reactions which one only exaggerates, spiralling into the egocentric doom. ",

            "One always hopes that it will all change. Once the ‘I’ starts fresh and wakes up to a new day, everything will be alright. Then the ‘I’ can finally become a loving partner, kind friend, engaged citizen. But with time one gets tired and learns that there is no escape to the illusion and the torment it generates. That one needs to reject the notion of the ‘I’ but at the same time reject the need to do it. One goes in a circle, being tossed by the projections of ego, external and internal. Understandably, loosing hope and giving into dysmorphia. The only solution is to coincide with the contents of the consciousness, flow without creating a narrative of it.",

On the one side the colors of the images of waves, forest, underwater reef are bleeding into the silhouette of the person entering the space. The feeling of calm is reflected in the sounds of wind and birds. The opposing screen shows burning destruction, glitchy horror happening outside of the person’s reflection, with a dissolution of crimson reds and blacks inside it. Sounds of underwater volcanoes and explosions accompany the turmoil.",
            "When one travels between the two extremes, one notices an invisible border in the middle, that unveils where one arrives, and blurs the place that is left behind.",
            "The structure resembles the one of triptych, contraposing two states of the internal, emotional and external, environmental, with the viewer in the middle of ‘The Garden of Earthly Delights’, exerting their agency over the order and the chaos, Eden and Last Judgement.",
            "What makes us different from the earthly characters of Bosh’ imagination is that we can see what happens to the left and to the right, behind and in front of the central panel. Sheltered on one side, we can see the bombs detonating, feel the earth trembling from its impact. Running from the horrors of hell, we are safe on the other side of the imaginary line.",
            "This simple form of a triptych escapes the false subtleties and elaborated explanations of the current-day manipulators, and portrays a cry that has stayed unchanged for centuries. Why do I deserve to live and you don’t? Do I have any agency? Childish cries - one might say it is about politics, history, money. Watching people fleeing their homes, being tortured and dead - in the face of it all this explanation still doesn’t make sense.",
            "Borges warns of imaginary, constructed worlds, warns of the emergent triptychs.",
            "‘Ten years ago any symmetry with a semblance of order - dialectical materialism, anti-Semitism, Nazism - was sufficient to entrance the minds of men. How could one do other than submit to [the constructed symmetry], to the minute and vast evidence of an orderly planet? It is useless to answer that reality is also orderly. Perhaps it is, but in accord­ance with divine laws - I translate: inhuman laws - which we never quite grasp. The contact and the habit of [the constructed, symmetrical planet] have disintegrated this world. Enchanted by its rigor, humanity forgets over and again that it is a rigor of chess masters, not of angels.’",
            "Rigorous drawing of invisible lines disturbs the inhuman laws of this world, that we so eagerly want to make our own. At the same time, the very human nature of our constructs makes them paradoxically pointless - why did we agree that this invisible line goes here, what is the reason for creating hells and heavens of this world, side by side.",
            "The construction of fake dualism, idealistic and absurd, serves the chess masters playing within their squares of the divine board ignoring the suffering of everything that happens to appear on it.",

That's how much living frightens and torments me.’",

            "As Adam and Eve tasted the forbidden fruit, they got to distinguish what good and evil is. They became god-alike and paid the price by being forced to leave the Garden of Eden. The search for this mythical place is an ongoing venture for many, but I will argue that, if it ever existed, it may never be found again, not anymore. The paradise has been destroyed - by exterminating thousands of plant and animal species, destroying their habitats, and introducing drastic climate changes. Humanity carries the burden of vanity and does not cease to judge what is right, or, for that matter, which species deserve to live and which do not. By employing the role of gods on this planet, we did not leave Eden - we destroyed it and abandoned it.",
            "To prove that this metaphor is neither a dramatizing nor an overstatement, it is enough to become familiar with the scientific consensus that humanity is driving itself and all other species on this planet to certain extermination. Elizabeth Kolbert in her book “The Sixth Extinction” calls the Anthropocene the next wave of mass annihilation of life on Earth and is not alone in her conclusions. With this work, I would like to visualize where we came from and where we are heading, given the current trends and socio-economical systems.",
            "In the animation, one starts in the Garden of Eden, surrounded by flora, not found anymore in this type and size, and animal species, currently endangered or extinct, living in peace and serenity. Upon opening the eyes again, one finds him/herself in the uneasy, terrifying environment, dry and overflowing with livestock. This transition represents several dimensions of the issue of diminishing biodiversity. Approximately 96% of the mammals’ biomass on Earth comprises humanity and its livestock and in the last 50 years, the number of populations of wild animals dwindled by 60% - continuing this trend drives the wildlife extinct and fosters the absurd level of meat and dairy consumption, impossible to sustain the future tens of billions of people. This is Adam and Eve choosing who deserves to live - the species which cannot be eaten or tanned do not have a place in the world we create. Climate change and oceans acidification are other factors that diminish the natural habitats of fauna and flora, with the coral reefs being one of the first environments to become extinct in a couple of decades, represented in the second landscape as the “burning” backdrop of the whole scene. Immersed in the intense sounds of the jungle, in the beginning, one can hear the signing of many kinds of birds and insects. These animals are facing annihilation, with e.g. 75% decrease in the number of insects in the protected areas in Germany in the course of the last 30 years.",
